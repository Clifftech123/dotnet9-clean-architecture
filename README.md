## **ðŸ›  Project Overview**  

This project showcases how to build a **REST API** from scratch using Clean Architecture principles. It covers essential concepts such as:  
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
- **Repository Pattern**  
- **Dependency Injection**  

We also integrate widely used open-source libraries like **MediatR**, **AutoMapper**, and tools like **EF Core** and **Postman**, all within the powerful **.NET 9 framework**.  


## **ðŸš€ Features**  
- **Clean Architecture Principles**: A structured, maintainable, and scalable solution.  
- **Open-Source Libraries**: Incorporates MediatR and AutoMapper for optimal performance.  
- **SQL Database Integration**: Connect and test APIs using Postman.  
- **Industry-Level Patterns**: Apply CQRS, repository, and unit-of-work patterns.
